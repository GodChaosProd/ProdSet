# ProdSet
Hiya vore enthusiasts! This is an addon for the Starbound Simple Vore Mod (SSVM) for Starbound (obviously).

You need to have the main SSVM mod for this one to function properly, specifically for the NPCs and sounds.

More information can be found on the codex, but this addon adds in 6 SPOs and 3 NPCs! It also introduces a new sort of SPO, known as an HSPO (The H stands for "Hybrid") which can play multiple scenarios!

There is an optional Alternate Lee-Zha mod that you can decide to use if you wish, but do be warned that it also adds in a new tile.

Thanks, and have fun!
